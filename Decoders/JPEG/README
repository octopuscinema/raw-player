Minimalist JPEG decoder & encoder
=================================

Decoder

- written in C99
- can parse YCbCr, YCCK and grayscale images
- can handle 8-bit or 12-bit samples
- can handle subsampled components
- can handle restart markers
- supports interleaved and non-interleaved scans
- supports Motion JPEG
- does not support progressive JPEG files
- does not support arithmetic coding

Encoder

- written in C99
- supports subsampled components (4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0)
- uses interleaved scan
- supports quality setting (1..100)
- support color and grayscale images
- uses default Huffman table or optimized tables
- can handle 8-bit and 12-bit input images
